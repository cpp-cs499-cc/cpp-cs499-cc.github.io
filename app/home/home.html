            <h3>How to use this website:</h3>
            <p>
                This website was designed as a tool to test your http endpoints for formatting and to verify that they
                work before submitting your cloud computing assignment. The main assignment here will be focused on the
                documents section.
            </p>
            <p>
                After selecting the documents page you will be presented with a
                <a href="https://puu.sh/twXdc/cbd0934ca1.png">popup</a>
                asking for an endpoint. You should enter a url linking to the json of your documents list
                (see instructions for endpoint #1).
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you enter a correctly implemented endpoint, the documents page should look
